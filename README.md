    * 🖼️ **Raw Pixel Display**: Directly maps binary data to pixel colors, offering a raw, unfiltered visual representation of your file's internal structure.
    * 📈 **Waveform**: Data is rendered as oscillating lines, akin to audio waveforms, giving the impression of your file "singing" its contents.
    * 🌈 **Rainbow Gradient**: Data dynamically influences color shifts, generating a mesmerizing rainbow backdrop that pulsates with your file's rhythm.
    * 🌀 **Noisy Vortex**: Data controls the rotation speed of a dynamic vortex, creating an abstract visual journey as your file spins through a digital cosmos.
    * 🌧️ **Pixel Rain**: Data dictates the density and color of falling pixels, transforming your file into an immersive downpour of digital rain.

* **Data-Driven Uniqueness**: Each visualization mode deeply interacts with your file's data, ensuring that different files yield entirely distinct video outputs. Your `hello.txt` and `cat.jpg` will result in vastly different, yet equally captivating, visual experiences!

* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle for Optimal Viewing**: Concerned about eye strain during late-night explorations? Seamlessly switch between dark and light themes to protect your eyes and enhance your UI aesthetic! 😎
